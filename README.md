## Getting started

1. Fork and clone this repo.
2. `npm install`.
3. Read the rest of this `README.md` carefully. 
4. Create `final-project` and `final-project-test` databases.
5. Start the build process and your application with: `npm run start-dev`. If you're using Windows, you may need to execute `npm run start-server` and `npm run build-watch` separately (in their own terminal tabs).
6. If you navigate to [localhost:1337](http://localhost:1337), you should see some UI already :) [We've provided some code to get you started]
7. Check out the starting seed file in `seed.js` - you can run it by executing `npm run seed`. You will need to seed the database once you've set up the Sequelize models.
